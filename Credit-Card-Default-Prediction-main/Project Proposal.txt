Problem or Opportunity Addressed: By identifying clients who are likely to default on their credit card payments, banks and financial institutions can take preemptive actions, such as offering financial counseling, restructuring debt, or limiting further credit extension, thus potentially reducing the financial loss.

Scope: Train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a credit card client defaulting in the next month based on their historical data.
